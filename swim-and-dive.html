    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
    <p>We rely heavily on the support of our team parents. Parents are expected to help at
    three meets and also one or two shifts at the city meet, but there are LOTS of ways to
    get involved! Check out these job descriptions to see where you can plug in!</p>

        </header>
        <p>A timer is assigned to each lane and given an electronic timer which starts automatically
        for each race. The timer's job is just to hit the button when the swimmer finishes and record
        the swimmers time. The runners take the recorded times from the timers and take them to the
        score table.</p>

        <p>The callers sit on the side of the pool at the finish end and watches as the
        swimmers finish. They call out the lane number as each swimmer finishes. The scribes
        write down what their caller calls out. There are a caller and a scribe pair on each
        side of the pool (each team provides one of each) doing the same thing.</p>

        to go watch your swimmer!</p>

        </header>
        <p>Each swimmer has a card with their name, lane, and event on it. The "pinks and
        blues" person stands or sits at the shallow end of the pool and hands the cards to
        our team’s swimmers as they come to swim their race. The swimmers know to come get
        their cards. Swimmers will then hand their card to the timer when it’s time for them
        to swim. For swimmers 8 years old and under, this person will give the card directly
        to the appropriate timer (it will have the lane number on it) instead of the
        swimmer.</p>

          <h3>Bull Pen</h3>
        </header>
        <p>These two people help get the younger kids to their races. The bull pen workers
        have a copy of the meet heat sheet (the events schedule) and call the kids names to
        get them together and to their starting position. You do not have to know the kids
        names to do this! This is a great way to meet the kids and learn their names. The
        kids usually all sit together in our team area, or they will be very close by with
        their parents. The younger swimmers even have their names written on their shoulder
        in sharpie! The coaches will also be around helping and cheering!</p>

          <h3>Ref, Starter, and Stroke &amp; Turn Judges</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The ref runs the overall swim meet. The starter calls out the events and starts
        each race. The stroke &amp; turn judges watch the swimmers for technical violations.
        These positions require some special training, but they're all done by volunteers!
        If you're interested in getting started as an official, stroke &amp; turn judging is
        a great place to start. Contact the swim team manager to find out about training
        opportunities.</p>
