          <p>When you join Whitesburg Pool, you're not just
          paying to get in: you're joining a community with a tradition of summer memories reaching
          back over 50 years! Since 1962, families in South Huntsville have gathered at Whitesburg
          Pool to celebrate summer together. Join us today and become part of our continuing
          legacy.</p>

          <p>To join the pool, you must purchase a membership (a one-time purchase) and pay annual
          dues. Annual dues are due by May 1st. The table below gives more details.</p>
