          <h3>Fees</h3>
          <p>Swim team fees include t-shirts as shown below. Dive fees do not include a t-shirt. Swim
            caps, and extra shirts can be purchased at an additional cost if desired.</p>

          <p>If you aren't a full pool member, you'll need to purchase a <a href="/join-now.html">swim/dive team

            fees shown below. However, consider getting a trial membership instead, which will
            allow your whole family to come to the pool all summer long.</p>
