        We are a member-owned pool, so to join you have to purchase a membership. This is a one-time
        purchase and it represents your share of ownership in the pool, including voting privileges.
        There are a limited number of total memberships available. Your membership can even be sold
        or transferred to another family. Members must also pay dues each year (including the year
        you purchase the membership). This is our primary source of income to operate the pool.

        If you have never been a member before, you can also opt for a trial membership. This
        membership type doesn't confer ownership or voting rights, but does allow your family full
        access to the pool for the summer. This is a great way to try out the pool and see if a full
        membership is right for you.

        For details on the cost of memberships, dues, and trial memberships, click <a href="/join-now.html">here</a>.

      <dt class="font-semibold">Once I'm a member, how do I get access to the pool?</dt>
      <dd class="mt-2 pr-12">Our pool is staffed by lifeguards during operating hours. Once you have
        submitted your membership form and paid the appropriate fees, you will be added to our list
        of members. Just show up, give your name to the lifeguard at the front desk, and enjoy your
        time at the pool!
